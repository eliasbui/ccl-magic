## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: New Feature Development

**Customer Request**: "I need a new user authentication system with OAuth integration"

1. **Request Intake**: Task created with priority "high"
2. **Department Assignment**: Routed to Development Services Department
3. **BA Analysis**: Business Analyst creates user stories and requirements

8. **Security Review**: Security Engineers perform security assessment

### Example 2: Bug Fix

**Customer Request**: "Urgent: Users can't reset their passwords"

1. **Request Intake**: Task created with priority "critical"
2. **Department Assignment**: Routed to Development Services Department
3. **Triage**: Development Lead assigns to available Developer

## Task Routing Logic

### Department-Based Routing
- Keywords trigger department assignment:
  - "feature", "bug", "code", "implement", "develop" → Development
  - "deploy", "ci", "cd", "infrastructure", "monitoring" → DevOps
  - "security", "vulnerability", "audit", "compliance" → Security
  - "test", "qa", "testing", "quality", "validation" → QA

### Role-Based Routing
- Tasks are assigned to specific roles based on content:
  - "requirement", "analysis", "user story", "business" → BA
  - "project", "plan", "timeline", "coordination" → PM
  - "product", "backlog", "prioritization", "vision" → PO
  - "architecture", "design", "technical lead" → Technical Lead
  - "code review", "mentor", "technical guidance" → Development Lead
  - "test strategy", "quality assurance", "test lead" → QA Lead

### Skill-Based Matching
- Tasks requiring specific skills are routed to members with those specializations:
  - "go", "golang" → Go developers
  - "python", "py" → Python developers
  - "docker", "container" → DevOps Engineers
  - "kubernetes", "k8s" → DevOps Engineers
  - "security", "vulnerability" → Security Engineers
  - "test", "testing", "qa" → QA Engineers

## Auto-Scaling Logic

### Scale-Up Conditions
- Department utilization > 80%
- Available members < minimum required
- Task queue length exceeds threshold

### Scale-Down Conditions
- Department utilization < 20%
- Members have no active tasks for extended period
- Cost optimization required

### Role Scaling
- Maintains optimal ratio of different roles:
  - Developers: 6 per department
  - Lead Developers: 2 per department
  - QA Engineers: 4 per department
  - DevOps Engineers: 3 per department
  - Other roles as configured

## Health Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Response time monitoring per role
- Task success rate tracking
- Uptime and availability metrics
- Role-specific performance thresholds

### Unhealthy Member Detection
- Consecutive failed health checks
- Performance degradation
- Communication failures
- Task completion issues

## Event-Driven Notifications

### Task Events
- Task created, assigned, in progress, completed, failed
- Real-time status updates to team members
- Leadership notifications for critical tasks

### Member Events
- Member joins, leaves, status changes
- Health status updates
- Performance alerts

### Department Events
- Scaling events (up/down)
- Department status changes
- Resource utilization alerts

## Customer Portal Interface

### Request Submission
- Intuitive form for submitting development requests
- Priority selection (low, medium, high, critical)
- File attachments and documentation
- Progress tracking and status updates

### Status Monitoring
- Real-time request status

- Team assignments and progress
- Communication history

### Reporting
- Request history and metrics
- Team performance analytics
- Department utilization reports
- Quality and satisfaction metrics

- Falls back to standard CCL-MAGIC behavior when disabled
- Maintains all existing CCL-MAGIC functionality
- Adds department management as an optional layer

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing CCL-MAGIC configurations continue to work
- Department features are opt-in
